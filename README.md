## About Me

I am a Software Engineer focused on backend development, with hands-on experience building APIs, data access layers, and business-oriented systems using Java and the Spring ecosystem.

I enjoy working close to real-world problems, translating business rules into clear, maintainable code. My background allows me to collaborate effectively with different stakeholders while maintaining a strong engineering mindset.

Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in backend architecture, databases, and system design, always aiming for simplicity, clarity, and scalability.
